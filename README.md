# Spam_Filtering_Model

    E-mail spam continues to become a problem on the Internet. Spammed e-mail may contain many copies of the same message, commercial advertisement or other irrelevant posts like pornographic content. The performance of the datasets is evaluated based on their accuracy, recall, precision and F-measure. In our research we made use of Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm for e-mail spam filtering on the dataset. The results showed that our spam detection model performed really well on the dataset and had an high classification accuracy.

   A spam filter is a program that is used to detect unsolicited and unwanted email and prevent those messages from getting to a user's inbox. Like other types of filtering programs, a spam filter looks for criteria on which it bases judgements. There is no such thing as a perfect spam filter. Even the most popular email services are susceptible to major weaknesses such as the best spam filters are unable to block 100 percent of spam messages and legitimate emails are often routed to junk email, or spam, folders, as spam filters often misclassify legitimate emails.
